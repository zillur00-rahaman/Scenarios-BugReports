Happy scenario 1: Bounce Rate

Title: Bounce rate averaging 13.67% annually.

Evaluation: Bounce rate is one the on the Dashboard that illustrates the average of bounce rate in monthly basis. As per illustration of the Bounce rate graph, we see at the beginning of the year it rate was 0%. In February, the average of bounce rate has gone up to 14.67% then in March it fall down a little to 8.33%. It has been increased sharply in April to 33.33% but fallen sharply in the month of June to 6.00% only. The average of Bounce rate then gone up gradually during next two month and in August, it was exactly 20.00%. After a marginable decrease in the next month, it was then hit the peak value to 40.00% before it sharply fall down to 00.00% in December.

Happy scenario 2: Monthly pageviews

Title: Illustration of average monthly pageviews and unique pageviews.

Evaluation: Monthly pageview is one of the charts located at the bottom of the Dashboard. It illustrates the total number of pageviews and unique pageviews from January to December. In January, the number of pageviews was 232 and the number of unique pageviews was 126 followed by 123 and 71 respectively in February. They were then gone up a little bit in the next month and in April, the numbers have not been changed much. The numbers of pageviews for both cases have sharply increased in the month of June and hit the peak at 622 and 312 respectively.  They were then gone down in July and August followed by a sharp decrease to the following month. The number of monthly pageviews and unique pageviews were then increased again in October before they were falling down in the following months. Therefore, after evaluating the chart, we can say that the number of pageviews and unique pageviews were fluctuating throughout the year. It clearly, illustrate that the number in both cases were high in the middle of the year where the average pageviews were 304.
